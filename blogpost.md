I have always been a creative person, an artist even. In college I majored in creative writing and was in a punk band. From a young age my beliefs were shaped by ideas dating back to nineteenth century Romanticism emphasizing emotion, individualism, glorification of the past, and rebellion against scientific rationalism. These ideas continued to influence art movements through the twentieth century, which is mostly where I encountered them through things like the Beat poets, the existentialists, the folk revival, and punk. I hated anything to do with numbers. I saw myself as “not like other girls.” I read books like *The Catcher in the Rye* and *On the Road* and believed I identified with the male protagonists. I thought being suicidal made me an interesting person. 

But Romanticism’s division between creativity and logic separated me from the STEM fields, which has not only resulted in life-long poverty but means I haven’t pursued activities that I might otherwise have been interested in. When I was encouraged by a colleague and former Praxis fellow to apply for the Praxis fellowship, my initial reaction was: “I delete every email with the words ‘digital humanities’ that crosses my inbox.” I shocked myself when I actually opened the link he sent me with the program’s description, mostly because graduate students are encouraged to do anything we can to get out of our teaching responsibilities. When I read the Scholar’s Lab’s and previous Praxis fellow charters, for the first time since arriving at grad school I encountered folks who sounded like they cared about the people around them. 

Once I decided that I was going to apply, I began thinking about what it would actually mean for me to learn to code, a dreaded activity that I had spent my life adamantly refusing. Those romantic myths that are engrained into my being came with many misogynistic side effects that have had to be painfully unlearned, and my alienation from the STEM fields is one of them. I see my efforts to learn Python as a rebellion against the male artists, poets, and musicians who told me that logic and reason can’t be used for creative ends. 

My hatred of coding isn’t all the Romantics’ fault, though. Silicon Valley’s tech bro culture that has accelerated late-stage capitalism and eroded our democracy did not make me inclined to try learning to code sooner. Who can forget the scene in The Social Network where Jesse Eisenberg’s Mark Z creates Facebook to rate the hotness of girls at Harvard in the wake of a breakup? The overprivileged and overconfident men of tech have gate-kept the field, making fewer women involved in computing than ever before. 

This is why the culture of digital humanities was such a shock to me. People declaring that they care about each other [in manifestos](https://www.humanitiesblast.com/manifesto/Manifesto_V2.pdf) against the toxic culture of academia? This is more anti-capitalist than the neoliberalized academic department where I do my touchy feely humanities work. 

I still think the Romantics had some good ideas and made art that I continue to love despite its flaws. Their theories responded to the alienation and environmental destruction they witnessed along with the Industrial Revolution, which is pretty relatable as we go through climate apocalypse. Horror movies are my comfort food. Many of the early Romantics were radicals involved with or sympathetic to the French Revolution. I’ll probably always be an emotion and intuition person rather than a logical person, but I can learn to code and still be a romantic.
